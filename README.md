## What’re we building?

A web app that allows photographers (creators) to post photos along with the original so that users can give feedback in a thread-like format. Very similar to Reddit. Users can post a photograph with the original and a link is generated that they can share with others. Authenticated users can leave constructive criticism “CC” on others’ posts.

## Possible Feature List
* Users should be able to create an account and log in
* Google auth?
* Facebook auth?
* Users should be able to create a post with photos
* Posts should have a shortened URL created that they can share with others (similar to the google docs sharing feature)
* Users can leave feedback (constructive criticism or ‘CC’) on other users' post
* Users can reply to feedback
* Users can like posts
* Users cannot see other feedback until they’ve provided feedback
    * Optional: Users click a button that shows other users’ feedback
    * default: Other’s feedback hidden.
* Users can create groups to that you can send photos. i.e. landscape photography group, portrait group, homies group.
* Privacy settings for link
    * only invited peepz
    * public
